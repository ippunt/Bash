Big take away % strips out quickest substring
%% strips out longest substring of match
So basically % cuts it out as soon as it finds it
%% cuts it out at the last option
HAD TO QUICKLY SEE THIS IN ACTION
#!/bin/bash
dog="abseghetueutehhh"
echo $dog
newdog=${dog%e*}
echo $newdog
newnewdog=${dog%%e*}
echo $newnewdog
output:
abseghetueutehhh
abseghetueut
abs
